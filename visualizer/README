== Dependencies ==
To compile and run this you will need qt and the OpenGL libraries for Qt.
These dependencies are already satisfied by campus computers so you don't
have to do anything.  If you're installing at home you will need to install
these.

On ubuntu, you'll be running:
<todo>ADD APTITUDE COMMAND FOR INSTALLING QT</todo>

== Compiling ==

If you have just pulled from the repository for the first time you will have
to run qmake-qt4 on campus machines and qmake at home.

What this does is looks at the visualizer.pro file which contains any
configuration details for the Makefile and generates the Makefile.

If you ever pull from the repository again, it is probably good practice
to go ahead and run qmake again.  Once your makefile is generated run 'make'
to compile.  It should automatigically compile everything that was specified
in the visualizer.pro file.

The sexp library for the parser needs to be compiled, so if you get errors
that you're missing sexp.a, go to the parser directory and run make.

== Modifiying visualizer.pro ==

If you ever add a source/header file to this project, add an additional
library, or anything else compiler related, you will have to modify
visualizer.pro.

If you add a header file, such as example.h, go to the visalizer.pro file
and add the line:
HEADERS += example.h

Similarly for a source file, example.cpp, you would add:
SOURCES += example.cpp

If you have a source or header file which is operating system specific, add it
in the following manner:

win32 {
  SOURCES += winExample.cpp
  HEADERS += winExample.h
}
unix {
  SOURCES += unixExample.cpp
  HEADERS += unixExample.h
}
